# Public Catalog

The TPX Device Public Catalog Repository contains information about LoRaWAN end-devices, this acts as a key data source for device catalogs and on-boarding devices on LoRaWAN networks.

Under the **vendors'** directory, you can find all vendors registered.

This repository is designed to be improved by you! For this, in order to add Devices Profiles, Drivers, etc... You can create a pull request, in **vendors** which will be validated by our team to be published.

Thanks to this, the integrity of the catalog is guaranteed and the experience as well.

You can find a sample [here](./template) to get you started, with a **README.md** that explains the overall structure and a step by step guide for developers.
If you already have a driver compliant to the [standard LoRa Alliance CoDec API format](https://resources.lora-alliance.org/home/lorawan-payload-codec-api), or intend to write one, a sample with detailed comments is available [here](https://github.com/actility/device-catalog/blob/main/template/sample-vendor/drivers/README.md).

>Any modification on this repository should be done by creating a new pull request to be reviewed by Actility before submission.
