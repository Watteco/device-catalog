# Simple description of the driver functionalities
description: >
  Driver for the EP5000 Atmospheric Air Quality Sensor.
  The EP5000 is an advanced environmental sensing device offering 13 key measurements in a single compact probe.
  It monitors major pollutants and ambient conditions, including:
  COâ‚‚, VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), sulfur-based odors, Fine Particulates (PM1, PM2.5, PM10),
  Noise (peak and average), Light (intensity and color temperature), Humidity, Temperature, and Atmospheric Pressure.
  Optional gas detection available for NOx and Ozone.
# Mandatory - id of the company that developed the driver
# This id will be used to construct the id of the driver (Should be in lowercase, no special characters, maximum 8 characters)
producerId: nanosens
# Email of the developer

# In case of a driver per model: `<vendorId>:<modelName>:<modelVersion>`
# In case of a driver for multiples model: `<vendorId>:generic:<genericVersion>`
# Format: `<8 characters max>:<16 characters max>:<digits only>`
# Needed for linking the model with a specific driver -> must be the same one used in model.yaml in the corresponding model
# You should have only one protocolId per driver
protocolId: nanosens:ep5000:1
# This is to specify the type of functions signature used in this driver. Possible values: actility, lora-alliance, ttn, chirpstack.
# Keep it empty if you followed the lora-alliance payload codec api
